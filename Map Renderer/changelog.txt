Changes (2019-09-05):
- Added building rubble feature for RA2/YR.

Changes (2019-08-13):
- Re-enabled the use of gui_settings.xml for UI settings.

Changes (2019-08-01):
- Added parameter for modconfig.xml to crop the map bottom during the image rendering for local size option. Values can be in range of 0 to 16.
- Added parameter for modconfig.xml to adjust map lighting with comma separated values for ambient, red, green and blue. This delta value is added to the values obtained from the map's lighting section. Decimal values can be in range of -1 to 1.

Note: The cropping of bottom rows is applicable for image rendering (JPEG/PNG) only with local size option. It does not affect the preview window or preview map pack generation or when used with full size option. When the bottom rows of the map have some height, it shows vacant portion. To avoid that, there is a cutoff logic which will override the modconfig parameter for cropping the bottom rows when its number of rows to crop are higher.

- Fixed: Facings corrected for SHP vehicles where its ART.ini section won't have WalkFrames=1 specified.
- Fixed: Shadow problem(s) fix for rendering the first instance of a 32-facing SHP vehicle placed on its first or last 8 directions.

Changes (2019-07-04):
- Added 32-Facing support for SHP Vehicles with SHP turrets and corrections to 8-Facing cases.
- Added parameter for modconfig.xml to disable tiberium remap for TS mods.
- Added shapes for startup location marker namely Squared, Circled, Diamond and Ellipsed with size options of 2-6.

- Added show tunnel path lines option.
- Components are made optional. Either generate PNG/JPEG/Thumbnail or use modify map features or use preview window.
- Few UI changes, clear button for log and main application remembers its location.

Notes on show tunnel lines option: With the last version of FinalSun not showing tunnel lines, this feature allows to visually verify tunnel plottings in maps. Tunnel lines are drawn for both to and fro between the tunnel ends and missing directional entries are shown with dashed lines. It comes with additional option to raise the drawing of tunnel lines by 4 cells which makes it look better with the tunnel entrance graphics. This option can be unchecked when using it on flat maps.

- SHP vehicles are now rendered properly with base, turret or barrel etc. with correct facings like the TS Titan SHP unit. (no 32 facing support)
- Fix-tiles now also checks for existence of the subtile index in a tile.
- Tiles/Cells with Ice growth option set can now be viewed as there is no option to view those in FinalSun. (used in TS snow maps)
- Enabled the debug (diagnostic) window for release versions also with additional details and improvements.
- Option provided to use the input map filename itself for output image filenames.
- Building SHP turrets set with Image= in art.ini are now rendered like in TS Nod SAM turret.
- Building upgrades improved, now it works even with Image= usage in art.ini like in TS for upgrades of Component tower.

With updated OpenTK library needed for bugfix of voxel rendering on newer graphics card drivers, already non functional OSMesa support is now removed, so also are the hardware / software rendering options.

Package contains the updated map renderer and TSClient addon files to be copied into the tool folder.
