Description=GDI 3A: Locate and Secure Crash Site
Side=0
SideName=GDI
LongDescription=GDI forces in this sector have found something unusual and large that crashed nearby. Nod has taken an intense interest in whatever it is, so naturally we are interested as well.

Scenario=Maps\Individual Missions\GDI6A.MAP
FinalMovie=
Description=GDI 6A: Destroy Vega's Dam
Side=0
SideName=GDI
LongDescription=The hydroelectric dams in this area provide Vega's island fortress with almost limitless power. Destroying the dams will seriously cripple Vega's perimeter defenses and allow GDI to bring more weapons to bear against Vega's base.@@The dams are heavily fortified, so attacking them directly is not the best option. Surveillance indicates the key to destroying the dams lies in the destruction of two regulator stations. Without them, the dams' generators will overload and the dams will self destruct.@@ Objective One: Destroy the dams any way possible.

Side=0
SideName=GDI
LongDescription=It is imperative that you prevent the train carrying the crystals from reaching the Nod base. Recent ice melts in the region have washed out the only train bridge. However, Nod engineers are on their way to repair it, so you must move quickly. If you can get to the train before the bridge is repaired, we can recover the crystals with little trouble. Otherwise, we will have to assault the Nod base to reclaim the crystals. Remember, to stop the train, you must destroy the locomotive, not the cars, but the cargo car holds the crystals.@@ Objective One: Locate the train and destroy the locomotive before Nod engineers repair the bridge. The cargo car holds the crystals.@@ Objective Two: If the bridge is repaired and the train successfully reaches the Nod base, then you must locate and destroy this base to recover the crystals.

LongDescription=Umagon has requested help to rescue her people from a Nod prison. The prison is located on an island to the east. Nod has a strong force in the area, both in outposts and spread through the nearby city. We have limited resources and no reinforcements are available, so avoiding patrols is vital to your success. Umagon has a team in the area already - if you can find them, they may assist you. Make your way to the prison and release the hostages. Once the prison is secure, we will send a transport to evacuate Umagon's people. There may be SAM sites nearby, so make sure the way is clear for the transport.@@ Objective One: Locate the Nod prison.@@ Objective Two: Release and evacuate the prisoners.

[GDI9B]

Scenario=Maps\Individual Missions\GDI9B.MAP
FinalMovie=
Description=GDI 9B: Destroy Chemical Supply Station
Side=0
SideName=GDI
LongDescription=This chemical supply station is providing vast quantities of Tiberium toxins to a number of Nod research programs in the area. Destroying this site will seriously hinder further Nod research, and prevent this base from transporting reinforcements to others in the sector.@@Intelligence reports advise caution when near any of the chemical tanks and facilities, as the toxins contained within are highly corrosive and equally deadly to soldiers and vehicles.@@ Objective One: Find a suitable location for a base.@@ Objective Two: Destroy the Nod Chemical station.

CD=0
Scenario=Maps\Individual Missions\GDI10A.MAP
FinalMovie=
Description=GDI 10A: Destroy the Prototype Facility (A)
Side=0
SideName=GDI
LongDescription=One of two possible locations of the Prototype Manufacturing Facility. Use the mutants to locate the position of the production facility. The mutants must remain undetected. If Nod suspects enemy forces in the area, they will cloak the facility and deploy troops to destroy them. If the mutants can hide from the Nod troops for a short period, the base will assume the area is clear and uncloak. Once we record the location of the base, GDI Dropships will arrive with reinforcements.@@ Objective One: Using mutants you must locate the Prototype Manufacturing Facility.@@ Objective Two: Once the facility is located, reinforcements will be sent in to help construct a base. You are to destroy the Manufacturing Facility at this time.

LongDescription=Control of the mutants is in our grasp. Their headquarters is located to the north of your drop-off position. The units you will need to implicate GDI in this deception can be obtained by capturing the rest of the GDI base that you will start in. Do not mar the Brotherhoods name any further.

Side=1
SideName=Nod
LongDescription=You must reach the medical colony in the region without being prematurely detected by GDI and forcing a base evacuation. To prevent this, consider first destroying the three sensor towers protecting the base. Our new artillery unit should be sufficient for the job. Once inside the base, the capture of the mutant female should be easy.@@ Objective One: Find and destroy the GDI sensor towers without getting too close and getting detected by them.@@ Objective Two: Once the towers are destroyed, move on the base and capture the medical colony before Umagon, the Mutant, can escape.

LongDescription=The Nod base in this sector has been overrun by Tiberium life forms.

FinalMovie=
Description=NOD 10A: Destroy the Mammoth Mk.II Prototype
Side=1
SideName=Nod
LongDescription=GDI is set to test the prototype of their new weapon, the Mammoth Mark II. It is vital that we sabotage their production of this monster as soon as possible. Before we can do that however, we need to know where the test is being held. Send a Chameleon Spy into one of the Radar Facilities. The coordinates to the testing ground should be stored there. Be careful of the patrols in the area - we have only one spy available. Once we have the location of the test, construct a base and destroy the prototype. You now have access to the new Banshee aircraft, which should prove useful. Destroying the remainder of the GDI base is at your discretion, but the Mammoth MUST be destroyed.@@ Objective One: Spy on one of the GDI Comm Centers.@@ Objective Two: Destroy the Mammoth Mark II prototype.

LongDescription=Jake McNeil, brother of one of GDI's commanders, will be leading an inspection tour to a small GDI outpost in this area. His knowledge of GDI activities could be of great benefit to Nod's cause. Capture the GDI outpost with engineers, then disguise the base as GDI's and wait for Jake to make his inspection. When the signal is given, use the Toxin soldiers provided to "persuade" Jake to join Nod's forces. Once he is under our influence, EVAC him at the designated site.@@Be very careful not to alert GDI until we are ready to strike. If they detect Nod forces in the area, they will surely try to evacuate Jake.
