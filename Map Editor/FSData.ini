0=0 Attack target type,1,0,1,Attack the target type and repeat until all of that type are destroyed or the unit runs out of ammo. Selecting target to choose nearest or first created is affected by TargetDistanceCoefficientDefault.
1=1 Attack waypoint,2,0,1,Attack the object if present or the cell at the given waypoint. Action will change accordingly if a structure is present and the team member has attributes of Infiltrate or Engineer or Agent or C4.
