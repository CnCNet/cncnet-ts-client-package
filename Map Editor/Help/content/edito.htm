<b>Multiplayer map note:</b>Make sure you don´t give any buildings or units to any other players than Neutral and Special!<br><br><br>

If you want, for example, to create a new building, choose the building you want to build in the object browser at the left. Click on the map where the building should be placed. You can change the owner either by using change owner in the object browser and by double clicking on the building.<br><br>

To change some additional settings, double click on the building. Note that, if there is another unit/building at this position, this means if they overlap, the wrong properties dialog may appear. To avoid this, you can use Drag & Drop. If one the same field is more than one infantry unit, more than one dialog will appear, allowing you to change the settings of every infantry unit.<br><br>

To delete buildings or units, use "Erase objects" at the object browser (at the bottom).<br><br>

There is almost no difference between handling buildings, units, infantry and aircraft. It´s quite the same.<br><br>


<b>Drag & Drop:</b><br>
To move units and buildings, just click on them with the left mouse button, hold the button down and move the mouse. A line will appear and show the new position of the building/unit. After releasing the mouse button, the building/unit will be set there. Now, if you want to create a big army, a copy feature would be cool... well, it´s here! Before releasing the mouse button, just hold down shift, and the unit/building is copied! This is a very cool feature, I think.<br><br>


<b>Base nodes (single player maps only!):</b><br>
With base nodes you can tell the AI to build/rebuild buildings. Note that the house settings must be correct, too, in order for this to work. It seems that this doesn´t work in multiplayer maps, if you find out how to use it, please tell me. Use the object browser to create and delete nodes. Just select the option you want to use and click on an existing building.<br><br>


<b>Celltags:</b><br>
Celltags connect triggers with (a) specific cell(s). To create a celltag, click on the right mouse button and choose "Create Celltag". You will need to choose the tag connected to the celltag.<br>
To change this tag later, click on a celltag and choose "Celltag properties", or "Delete celltag" in order to delete it.<br><br>
