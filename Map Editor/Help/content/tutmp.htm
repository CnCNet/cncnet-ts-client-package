		Multiplayer map tutorial		</p>
	<p>	

This missions can be played in skirmish mode and in multiplayer game. <br><br>
<b>Creating the map:</b>
<br>
Create the map using File->New. Check the multiplayer box at the bottom (<b>very</b> important!).
Enter the map size and theater, and press OK. FinalSun/FinalAlert will automatically set up the map for multiplayer (except starting locations).<br><br>
<br>
Now finish your map. After you have done this, you can place the:<br><br>

<b>Player starting locations:</b>
<br>
If you use the File->New function to create a new multiplayer map, set the waypoints 0-X (X is smaller than 8) to set the starting location for players 0-X. If you want to have 3 players, set waypoints 0, 1 and 2 (if you make a Red Alert 2 map, please read the Red Alert 2 part below). <br><br>
<b> Red Alert 2 and Tiberian Sun:</b>
<br>
To play it, start TS/RA2, create a multiplayer/skirmish game and choose your map from the multiplayer map list (not by loading the map in the random map editor!)
<br>
<br><br>
<b>Tiberian Sun only:</b><br>
Note: if you play in the internet, the maximum time needed to transfer the files to every player is 40 seconds (TS only, RA2 does not automatically transfer the maps!).
This means, in a 4 player game, the map may have 110-130 kb. Hiding the preview will help to be smaller than 130 kb. 
<br><br><br>
<b>Red Alert 2 only:</b><br>
You have 2 options here:
<br>
<br><b>Automatic map transfer (standard):</b> This is the standard setting. It is turned on by Edit->Basic->Official set to "no". There are certain limitations to this: <br>
1. In Internet game, there is a maximum transfer time. If it is reached, RA2 will stop transferring and you won´t be able to play. <br>
2. If you don´t have 8 starting locations (waypoints 0-7), then RA2 will sometimes decide to use some random starting locations. This means you either set no starting locations and always let RA2 choose the starting positions or you place 8 waypoints. If you do the last in for example a 4 player map, you just place 2 waypoints for each starting location right next to each other. RA2 will only use one of these starting locations, never both! You´ve to restrict the game in RA2 to 4 players in this example (do not choose 7 other enemies).<br><br>
<b>Manual map transfer:</b> You can activate this by setting Edit->Basic->Official to "yes".
To play the map with other people, you have to send the map to everyone taking part in the game. Everyone must restart RA2 for the map to be recognized. The limitations for automatic map transfer do not apply, you only need 2 waypoints.


<br><br><br>
<b> Tiberian Sun only:</b><br>
If your TS version is not 1.15 or higher, you can use the following steps as an alternative to File->New:<bR>
1. Start TiberianSun.<br>
2. Create a new random map, don´t click on cancel but on OK.<br>
3. Exit Tiberian Sun.<br>
4. Load the file RandomMap.map in the Tiberian Sun directory in FinalSun.<br>
5. Edit the file.<br>
6. Save it as *.mpr file.<br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<b>Note: You cannot define your own houses in multiplayer, this means if you want to create a preexisting enemy base you need to use the "Neutral" house and use triggers to give it to another player.
</b>

<b>For triggers</b>: In multiplayer maps, the houses 0-7 are the different players (either human or AI).<br>
<b>Note: The triggers to give units and buildings to other players seem to only work for Tiberian Sun in multiplayer maps! In Red Alert 2, these cause Internal errors if used in multiplayer maps</b>
