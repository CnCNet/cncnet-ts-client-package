		Win/Lose-Triggers in singleplayer tutorial	</p>
	<p>	
For every single player map, you should set up win/lose triggers at least for the human player.
I assume you already have created your map and set up the houses (FinalSun/FinalAlert can do this automatically for you, you only need to define how much money everybody has).<br><br>

You should follow the <a href="tuttrig1.htm">general triggers tutorial</a>, with the following notes:
You need 2 triggers, 1 win and 1 lose trigger for the human player (set the human player as trigger owner).<br><br>

Win-Trigger:<br>
1. Event: For example "7 House destroyed by anybody" (use main enemy as house).<br>
2. Action: "1 Win game", use player house as house.<br><br>

Lose-Trigger:<br>
1. Event: For example "7 House destroyed by anybody" (use player house as house).<br>
2. Action: "2 Lose game", use player house as house.<br><br>

This is just a simple idea of how to create simple win/lose triggers.
