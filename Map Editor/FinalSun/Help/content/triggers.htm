		Triggers

	<p>

  Triggers are used to start certain events on the map. They consist of a general flags area, an event area, and an action area. The flags area just sets the name of the trigger and some things like if the trigger should repeat and who owns the trigger. The events define when this event shall occur. And finally, the actions define what happens if the events are true. Example: If time passed is 50 seconds, then send some units to the player.<br>

This is how the trigger editor looks like:<br><br>

The trigger editor has documentation about every trigger included, so I won´t go into details here. It should be quite self describing if you´ve read what I´ve written above.<br>
You can have a look at the <a href="tuttrig1.htm">Tutorial</a> to find out more.<br>
