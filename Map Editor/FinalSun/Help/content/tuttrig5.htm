<b>Creating & Using Triggers and Tags</b><br>
In addition to events and actions, triggers also have a structure called a tag associated with them.  Tags are identifiers for the triggers; they tag them for use.  The trigger editor with Final Alert automatically sets up and handles tags for you, but it is important to understand their purpose to accomplish many tasks.  One common such task is a trigger that will fire when an important unit is destroyed, such as Tanya.<br><br>

<b>To set a global lose variable after Tanya is killed:</b><br>
<img src="pics/wayp.jpg" height=1 width=20>1) Create a new variable called "Tanya lost" using Edit->Global variables<bR>
<img src="pics/wayp.jpg" height=1 width=20>2)	Create a trigger with the following attributes:<br>
<img src="pics/wayp.jpg" height=1 width=40>a.	Name: "Tanya Killed"<br>
<img src="pics/wayp.jpg" height=1 width=40>b.	Event: "48 Attached object destroyed"<br>
<img src="pics/wayp.jpg" height=1 width=40>c.	Action: "56 Set global", parameter is the variable you created<br>
<img src="pics/wayp.jpg" height=1 width=20>3)	Place Tanya on the map under the human player's control<br>
<img src="pics/wayp.jpg" height=1 width=20>4)	Double-click on Tanya to bring up her unit attributes.<br>
<img src="pics/wayp.jpg" height=1 width=20>5)	Change the "Attached Tag" property to "01000001 Tanya Killed 1"<br><br>

Simple, isn't it?  You can also edit tags and triggers separately using the outdated "Tags" and "Triggers" options under the Edit menu <i>(Matze: Not recommended ;)</i>.  Structures and vehicles can also be attached to a tag, in addition to any Teams you have created.  This is how the player wins when the Kremlin is destroyed (same event "attached object destroyed") or after a paradropped Yuri is killed.  Many actions also use tags, such as action 14, "Give attached objects to house".
