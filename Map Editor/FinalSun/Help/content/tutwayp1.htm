<b>Creating & Using Waypoints</b><br>
Waypoints are "flags" used to show special locations for events to occur, such as arriving reinforcements,  where to move the camera or (in multiplayer maps) to define the starting locations of the players.  Waypoints are created and deleted using the <a href="userinterface.htm">object browser</a> on the left side of the screen.<br><br>
<b>To create a waypoint:</b><br>
1)	Resize the browser to see the all the list options.<br>
2)	Two-thirds of the way down, you will see the "Waypoints" list item.  Click on the "+" to open the options for waypoints.<br>
3)	In the list are 3 options: "Create Waypoint", "Create Waypoint with Special ID", and "Delete Waypoint."  The first option will add a waypoint of the next available number to the map, the second gives it any number you wish, and the third deletes any waypoint on the map.  Select the second option, "Create Waypoint with Special ID".<br>
4)	Click anywhere on the <a href="userinterface.htm">iso view</a>.  A dialog box comes up.<br>
5)	Give the waypoint the number value "60".  This special number value will be used to identify the waypoint in the future.  Click OK.<br>
6)	An icon of a flag now appears at the spot you clicked, with the number you designated.<br><br>
<b>To delete a waypoint:</b><br>
1)	Open up the "Waypoints" list in the object browser.<br>
2)	Select "Delete Waypoint."<br>
3)	Click on the waypoint you wish to remove.<br>
4)	Note that you cannot use "Delete Object" to delete a waypoint!<br>
