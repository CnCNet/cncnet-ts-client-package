MapResize for TS & RA2

A small tool to resize maps of TS and RA2/YR. Prompted by shortcomings
of FinalSun/FinalAlert2 like can't resize beyond max size limitation of 
these map editors, doesn't process tunnels, smudges, base nodes etc. and
doesn't cleanup well.

It runs on Windows OS with .Net 4.0.

During resize process, this tool additionally performs these tasks:
- Removes comments
- Removes duplicates, discards entries in incorrect formats
- Better compressed IsoMapPack5 section (undone by FinalSun/FinalAlert2)

Limitations:
- Preview pack/image is not updated as it needs game files for map image.
Have to use map editors or CnC Map Renderer for that.
- It isn't smart enough to check if full tunnel path goes beyond map borders.

Updated source code is included in download package. This tool uses code from OpenRA, MapTool and CnC Map Renderer.
