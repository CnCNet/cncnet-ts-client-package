FSP features (2021-07-16):
Extended config [ExtConfigs] in FSData.ini:
- BrowserRedraw=yes to activate left panel object browser changes.
- BrowserRedraw.GuessMode (0/1), currently it uses Owner based sorting only, most of FA2sp for RA2/YR based processing is disabled.

- CopySelectionBound.Color to change color for drag selection for copying cells.

Left panel object browser display is taken over and rewritten, needs setting [ExtConfigs] BrowserRedraw=yes in FSData.ini.
- Ground list names are fetched from FSLanguage.ini based on theater (first 3 chars of [Map] Theater= based names in language file) instead of Ground1/2/3.
- Infantry, units, aircrafts and buildings can be grouped into sub-catogories which is defined in FSData.ini under section [Sides]. Every technotype can be given its grouping index number in [ForceSides] section. Others category is used for value -1 or undefined IDs.

Note: Currently left panel is initialized only on map load/create. It doesn't update on add/delete house or changes done through INI Editing. For those changes to appear, map should be saved and reloaded. The whole left panel changes could be disabled by setting [ExtConfigs] BrowserRedraw=no in FSData.ini, so as to use original left panel handling.
