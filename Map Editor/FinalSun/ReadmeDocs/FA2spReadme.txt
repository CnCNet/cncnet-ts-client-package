<pre>
I've decided to make this repository public so that more developers can help me improving it.
For now it had implemented all features that FA2Ext has and extended more logics than it.
The codes might be a messy, so I'd appreciate it if someone could help me to make them better arranged.

To clone the submodules, just run update_codes.bat.

- GETTING START
Just like Ares, FA2sp needs Syringe to work properly, so you can just take Ares as a reference.

What you need to know is that FA2sp requires Original FinalAlert 2 1.02 version, any modified version may occur unexpected errors!
Before you launch it for the first time, write the ini files below properly, especially for essential ones (marked by **)

If you still have any problem about it or something wrong occured while using it, please contact me directly or mail me at 3179369262@qq.com
For now, I cannot ensure the stability of it, so save your maps frequently before heavy loss! XD

- WORK IN PROGRESS
    - Support for cloning scripts & taskforces & ai triggers
    - SHP turret rotation (currently doesn't change and always points to the north)
    - Custom palettes
    - ...

- WRITE IN THE END
This project was developed after FA2Copy with still many bugs to fix,
then Zero Fanker advised to use inline hooks instead of Win32API message hooks to implement
more functions and fix more bugs, and finally we comes to FA2sp. 

Thanks to AlexB, who gave me many suggestions and useful infomation while disassembling it.
(Chatting with him in the midnight because of time difference is quite interesting, too)

Zero Fanker has made a great contribution to the setting up of this project, with many
essential suggestions put forward.

Caco did quite much test works for this project, also bringing out many problems I haven't 
noticed before.

tomsons26 has made great assistance on disassembing it(REALLY HELPFUL).

(btw the code of FinalAlert 2 is really in a MESSY! Full of unnecessary constructors. I HATE IT!)
