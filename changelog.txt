		- Tratos now spawns with green colors and changes to red only after you capture him.

- Fixed: FS GDI Campaign missions (Credits: Bittah Commander):
	- GDI 08 [FS]: Factory Recall:
		- Moving a unit onto one of the cells next to the walls surrounding imprisoned civilians now causes alternating voice lines to play of the civilians calling out for help.
	- GDI 09 [FS]: Core of the Problem:
		- Because this map only has AI triggers for Medium difficulty, they have now been enabled for easy and hard difficulty as well to make the AI more active.
		- A piece of an incorrectly placed cliff was visible through the shroud at the start of the mission.
		- The timings have been adjusted for the Core Defender activation video and CABAL voice line so that the Core Defender won't already have un-deployed by the time those start playing on the "Faster" game speed (60 FPS).
- Fixed: FS Nod Campaign missions (Credits: Bittah Commander):
	- Nod 03 [FS]: Tratos' Final Act:
		- The edges of the shroud glitched after capturing a GDI radar caused an area to be revealed.
	- Nod 04 [FS]: Mutant Extermination:
		- Mark the beacon on the radar every time the 2nd objective (return the truck to the beacon) is repeated.
	- Nod 05 [FS]: Escape from CABAL:
		- A cliff piece didn't properly connect to the water.
	- Nod 06 [FS]: The Needs of the Many!:
		- GDI's aircraft didn't respond to any of the villages being attacked.
		- GDI's radar is no longer disabled, but it now instead has Power=0 so that the player won't lose power after capturing it.
	- Nod 07 [FS]: Determined Retribution:
		- The first reinforcements that you received after fixing the eastern and western bridge were swapped and moved across the map to the end of the other bridge.
		- The Firestorm Wall and Laser Fence surrounding the CABAL Core were deactivated because they didn't have any power.
		- You couldn't hear all of CABAL's taunts at the end of the mission if the game speed was higher than "Slow" (20 FPS), so the delay between them has been increased to make sure that they can all be heard at 60 FPS.
	- Nod 08 [FS]: Harvester Hunting:
		- After saving the civilians, the trucks in the village will now blow themselves up and drop a crate instead of requiring the player to force-fire at them to get the crate.
		- You can no longer hear or see the ORCA Transport take off at the edge of the map before delivering your reward for saving the civilians.
		- After saving the civilians, the ORCA Transport now directly drops off 3 crates instead of trucks that explode before dropping crates.
		- The condition for playing one of CABAL's taunts has been changed from building a GDI War Factory to a time interval after the ORCA Transport has dropped off the crates (and Engineers).
		- After capturing a tech center gives you access to an MCV, building and deploying it now gives you access to Nod structures instead of GDI ones.
		- The bus in the lower left corner of the map will no longer reveal shroud for the player if damage causes it to move at some point.
	- Nod 09 [FS]: Core of the Problem:
		- Because this map only has AI triggers for Medium difficulty, these have now been enabled for easy and hard difficulty as well to make the AI more active.
		- The Rocket Infantry that you receive as reinforcements at the start now scatter after spawning, instead of standing on the same sub-cell and overlapping one another.
		- Multiple of CABAL's bases (including all Obelisks of Light on the map and most SAM-Sites) started with insufficient power to function, so 2 Advanced Power Plants were added to compensate.
		- The timings have been adjusted for the Core Defender activation video and CABAL voice line so that the Core Defender won't already have un-deployed by the time those start playing on the "Faster" game speed (60 FPS).
- Removed: Lin Kuei Ominae's large Kodiak (https://www.ppmforums.com/topic-41597-page-2).

Version 6.05b

- Fixed: The positions of various terrain objects and overlay (tiberium trees, clear rocks, sand rocks and fona) were offset towards the top or bottom in the map editor (Credits: Bittah Commander).
- Fixed: The positions of clear rocks and sand rocks were offset towards the bottom in-game on snow maps (Credits: Bittah Commander).
- Removed: Players can no longer select white in the game lobby because it looked too similar to the Civilians' grey.
