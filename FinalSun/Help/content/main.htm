<p>
FinalSun is a map and mission editor for Tiberian Sun.
You can download the newest version of it
<a href="http://finalsun.wagnerma.de">here</a>.
This manual was written for FinalSun 1.0.
</p>
<p>Make sure you at least read the tutorials, not doing this very often results in "internal errors". The main tutorial is located <a href="maptutorial.htm"> here</a>. It shows you how to do a completely new multiplayer map with bridges, water and cliffs. Very detailed, many pictures and therefore really recommended!
</p>
<p>You should also read the <a href="faq.htm">frequently asked questions</a> which should help you.</p>

<p>
You need to agree to the <a href="license.htm">license</a> if you want to use this editor. Else you are not allowed to use it. If you start the editor, you agree to the license.
</p>

<p>
<br>Manual notes:<br><br>
You should use at least Internet Explorer 4.x or Netscape 4.x to view this manual. I recommend turning on JavaScript
for Netscape, as this enables better display of the manual.
