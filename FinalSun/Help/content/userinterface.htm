		FinalSun consists of one main window. It is shown after FinalSun has completed
		loading.<br>
		In the main window you can open a map, save a map, create a new one, modify
		general characteristics of the map, edit the terrain and the units and,
		important, create and modify triggers, tags, teamtypes & taskforces.
		In this chapter I will concentrate on the IsoView. I will give further details what you see in the IsoView (yes, you see the map, but there큦 a bit more).<br>
		The biggest part of the main window consists of the isoview. It shows the map.
		
		You can size the different windows inside the main window. For example, hold
		down the mouse button on the thick line between the IsoView and the Terrain&Overlay
		Browser (below the scrollbar of the IsoView). Then you can move your mouse to
		the top and bottom and size the 2 windows as you need them. It큦 the same with
		the IsoView/Browser and the ObjectView.<br><br><br></p>

The iso view
</p>
<p>

Before the iso view is useable, you need to create a new map or load an existing one.<br>
You can scroll the iso-view by using the scrollbars. The "borders" of the map are in bright red, this means all inside this rectangle is the "real" map, all outside should be really ignored, no units should be set outside.<br>
You should see your map now. If it큦 a new map, it큦 quite boring, only one ground type and no units (except you imported a map). Else you should see some units/buildings, tiberium, different ground etc.
2 icons shown for 2 special things need to be explained:<br><br>
<img src="pics/wayp.jpg">This describes a waypoint. The waypoint number is written on it. Waypoints are very important for both singleplayer and multiplayer maps<br>
<img src="pics/cellt.jpg">This describes a celltag.<br><br>
