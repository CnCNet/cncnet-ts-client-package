Thanks for reading this file. Please read the whole file AND the manual
First a note: FinalSun is definitly not finished yet! So, there may be (crashing?) bugs. If you find some,
please report them by mail or by posting them at the forum on finalsun.wagnerma.de
If you create or edit a map, save very often and early, as this is still a beta version.

LICENSE
-------
You are not allowed to use this editor with a demo or illegal version of Tiberian Sun, buy the game and enjoy it :).
The program is freeware, so you get it "as it is", the author is not responsible for any damage caused by the program.
Electronic Arts and Westwood don앖 provide ANY support for this editor.
The editor is NOT a official editor of Westwood or Electronic Arts.
You may not sell maps created with this editor without written permission of the author of this editor.
-------

YOU NEED
--------
FinalSun:
- Win9x or Win2k
- DirectX 6

FinalSun: 
- Tiberian Sun installed 
- RAM: 32MB physical should be the lower limit, and the harddisk your page/swap file is on should have
  more than 150 MB free. 

I recommend using DirectX 8.0. It speeds up FinalSun and TS.


KNOWN ISSUES/BUGS
-----------------
- If FinalSun crashes while loading pictures, switch into another color mode by right clicking on your desktop and selecting properties. Select the correct tab and switch to another color mode. Then try again.
  If it doesn앖 work, try a lower resolution. And if even this doesn앖 help, check the end of this file that has additional notes
- Although FinalSun should now save every map on every PC fine, please save your work as often and early as possible. 


HOW TO START
------------
After FinalSun has finished loading, press F1 to show the manual and
some tutorials.
If after the release of this version any bugs get known, they will be listed at finalsun.wagnerma.de, probably
with a workaround idea if existing. So you should visit FinalSun.wagnerma.de if there are problems before
mailing me.

PLEASE!!! Read the manual by pressing F1 in FinalSun.

FAQ
---
Q:	How can I create a zoom trigger?
A: 	DeeZire answered this in an email he sent to me:
	If you wanted to zoom on a particular place, you must first use the 'move camera and scroll to waypoint' action (#48) and then zoom in. 
	The zoom rate is controlled by an undocumented keyword which must be placed in the [General] section of RULES.INI or your map file:
	ZoomInFactor=N    } I dont know how N is measured but a value of 4 works OK.
	Matze압 addition: It works to use Edit->Ini to create a [General] section inside the map file and insert the key.

Q: 	How can I create a really new map?
A: 	As FinalSun now offers support for creating new maps, there are now 2 ways to create new maps. Either
	you use File->New or you can create a multiplayer map in the random map editor in TiberianSun (before version 1.15 only!). 
	To do this, just create a random map and quit Tiberian Sun again. Now you can
	load the file "RandomMap.Map" into FinalSun and edit it.

Q:	Can I create new unit types?
A:	Now directly supported by SunEdit 2k. Download the newest release to get extended support.

Q:	Can I play the maps online? And use the new unit types online?
A:	Yep, but the synchronisation limit is at 40 seconds, thats enough for around 500-550kb (so 130-150 kb for the map
	for 4 players online). If this limit is broken, ... bad... :). You can use the unit types online.

Q:	How can I keep the map file small, so that I앐 able to play with 4 players online?
A:	Of course you can choose a small map size in the random map generator. Another possibility is to "hide" the preview.
	Just say "Yes" when the program asks you to do that when you save the map. Unfortunately the maps FinalSun produces are
	kinda big in this alpha, as mappack encoding doesn앖 use compression yet.

Q:	I already have maps / I앐 using a Rules.INI. Can I import my settings in this files?
A:	Yes you can. At the "All" Section, click on "Import another INI File". You can now choose what to import, whether
	only specified sections or the whole file (please DONT import the whole file if it압 too big, for example the
	rules.ini!). INI files are: *.mpr, *.map, *.ini.

Q:	Ok i았e made a multiplayer map. How can I play it?
A:	In Tiberian Sun in the map settings dialog, choose "multiplayer maps" and click on your one (mostly at the end of
	the list!). Note that you cannot load the map in the random map editor.

Q:	I았e created a single player mission by changing an existing one. How can I play it?
A:	You can name the file like the one that you changed (gdi1a.map, nod1a.map for orig TS, fsgdi01.map or fsnod01.map for Firestorm).
	A better solution: Copy FSBattle.ini from the FS to the TS directory and name it Battle.ini. Open the file with
	notepad and change the settings there, best way is to create a new campaign. Then you can choose your campaign
	in TiberianSun.

Q:	What is that new houses page?
A:	The main reason I have included this feature is for singleplayer maps. A house is a "player", for example
	the GDI, or the civilists. Note that this is not a side like GDI/NOD, it압 specific to the map.
	I have not yet tried out much with houses in Multiplayer yet, but I found out that only the standard
	houses "GDI", "Nod", "Neutral" & "Special" are supported, else the game could crash! An idea to implement
	a multiplayer map with a predefined enemy (with buildings etc!) would be to use Neutral or Special as
	AI-house (but i haven앖 tried out yet!).
	Always use "Prepare houses" before doing anything else in SP and MP if no houses are yet placed.
	 (it압 simple and it helps to don앖 make a mistake. 	Experienced users may not need to do this!).

Q:	What is that new drag & drop feature? (= how can I copy units/buildings or move them?)
A:	Instead of deleting a building and placing it somewhere else, you can now simply click with the left
	mouse button on the building and move your mouse with holded down mouse button. You can now see a line that
	shows where the building/unit will be placed at. If you stop holding down the button, the unit/building
	will be moved there. If you hold down additionally shift, it will be "copied" there, that means you can 
	create for example a big army without having to create every unit yourself.
	Note: if you move/copy a building and it is to big to be placed at the new position, no warning appears!
	That means you can probably get problems if you don앖 make sure that there is enough space!

*****************************************************
WORKAROUND IF FINALSUN CRASHES WHILE LOADING PICTURES
*****************************************************
First you should try switching to 16 bit color depth and probably a lower resolution.
If this doesn앖 work, you should make sure that c:\ (or where you have your swap file) has enough free space (300-400 MB are perfect).
If this also doesn앖 help, you can try to increase your swap file size manually (but please only do this if you are experienced!).
